# Step 2: PocketBase Collections Implementation Plan

This intermediate file outlines the plan for creating and configuring the necessary PocketBase collections for the YouKOL Clone project.

## Collections to Create/Configure

1. **Users Collection** (Extend built-in collection)
   - Add custom fields
     - avatar (file field)

2. **User Profiles Collection** (Create new)
   - Fields:
     - user (relation to Users)
     - display_name (text)
     - bio (text)
     - onboarding_completed (boolean)
     - usage_frequency (select)
     - content_types (json)
     - preferences (json)

## Implementation Approach

1. Check if PocketBase is running
2. Create a script to set up the collections programmatically
3. Execute the script to create/update collections
4. Verify the collections were created correctly

## Security Considerations

- Set appropriate permissions for each collection
- Ensure proper relations between collections
- Configure cascading delete for related records
