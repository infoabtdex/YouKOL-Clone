# Step 5: Authentication Routes Implementation Status

## Summary

After reviewing the codebase, I found that Step 5 (Create Authentication Routes) has already been fully implemented in the `server/routes/auth.js` file. This file contains all the required endpoints:

1. **Registration endpoint** (`POST /api/auth/register`)
   - Creates user in PocketBase
   - Creates associated user profile
   - Returns appropriate response

2. **Login endpoint** (`POST /api/auth/login`)
   - Authenticates with PocketBase
   - Sets up session
   - Returns user data (without tokens)

3. **Authentication verification endpoint** (`GET /api/auth/status`)
   - Checks authentication status
   - Returns user data if authenticated

4. **Logout endpoint** (`POST /api/auth/logout`)
   - Destroys session
   - Clears cookies

The implementation also includes additional features:
- Password reset request (`POST /api/auth/password-reset/request`)
- Password reset confirmation (`POST /api/auth/password-reset/confirm`)

All routes include proper validation, error handling, and security measures.

## Next Step: Profile Management Implementation (Step 6)

We need to implement RESTful API endpoints for user profile management:

1. Profile retrieval:
   - Get user profile data
   - Format for client consumption

2. Profile updates:
   - Update preferences
   - Store user settings

3. Onboarding flow:
   - Track completion status
   - Save onboarding preferences

### Implementation Plan

1. Create a new routes file: `server/routes/profile.js`
2. Implement the following endpoints:
   - `GET /api/profile` - Get current user's profile
   - `PUT /api/profile` - Update user profile
   - `POST /api/profile/onboarding` - Complete onboarding process
   - `GET /api/profile/onboarding/status` - Check onboarding status

3. Use appropriate middleware:
   - `requireAuth` for all endpoints
   - `attachUserData` for all endpoints
   - `requireOnboarding` for specific endpoints that need onboarding

4. Update documentation in the main guide to reflect completion of Step 5 and progress on Step 6.
